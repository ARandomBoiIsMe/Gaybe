# Gaybe
A hobby programming language.  
The compiler will be written in C.  
The file extension of this language is `.gay`.  
**Yes, I know my humor is childish.**

## Using the compiler
- ### Windows
  ```
  > .\build.bat
  > .\gaybe.exe <file.gay>
  ```

- ### Linux
  ```
  $ ./build.sh
  $ ./gaybe.exe <file.gay>
  ```

## To be added:
- Support for C compilers that aren't `gcc`
